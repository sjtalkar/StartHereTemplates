    "Suppose we have a known population, like all dogs in California.  So far, we've seen 3 ways of *predicting* something about an individual in that population, given incomplete knowledge about the identity of the individual:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we know nothing about the individual dog, we could predict that its speed is the *average* or *median* of all the speeds in the population.\n",
    "* If we know the dog's height but not its speed, we could use *linear regression* to predict its speed from its height.  The resulting prediction is still imperfect, but it might be more accurate than the population average.\n",
    "* If we know the dog's breed, height, and age, we could use *nearest-neighbor classification* (or *multiple regression*) to predict its speed by comparing to a collection of dogs with known speed.\n",

    "2. In the simple (but important) cases we'll look at today, conditional probabilities can be calculated exactly from assumptions, rather than being estimated from data. "
